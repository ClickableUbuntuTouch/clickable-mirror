Continuous Integration
======================

Clickable CI Docker Images
--------------------------

CI docker images are available for easily using Clickable with a continuous
integration setup. They can be found on Docker hub: ``clickable/ci-20.04-armhf``,
``clickable/ci-20.04-amd64`` and ``clickable/ci-20.04-arm64``.
The images come with Clickable pre installed and already setup in container mode.
