There is also a migration tool referenced in the guide.

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Configure Clickable globally with a new :ref:`configuration file <config.yaml>`.
- Integrated bash completion, to set up run ``clickable setup completion``.
- Run Clickable from sub-directories, not only project root.
- Added new ``chain`` command to run multiple Clickable commands in a chain.
- Added new ``script`` command to run scripts defined in the clickable.json config file.
- Added new ``ci`` command to open a shell in the Clickable CI container.
- The ``run`` command can now be provided with a library name to run within the respective image.
- The ``create`` command allows to create apps non-interactively configuring the template with command line parameters.
- The ``gdb`` command allows to export a GDB init script that can be used by any IDE's remote debugger.
- The behavior of the ``gdb`` and ``gdbserver`` commands can be configured in detail via command line parameters.
- The ``test`` command now runs ``cargo test`` by default for the ``rust`` builder.
- The ``rust`` builder supports the ``rust_channel`` field to configure the desired tool chain (e.g. ``1.56.1`` or ``nightly``).
- The ``rust`` builder supports the ``build_args`` field in the project config (arguments are forwarded to cargo).
- The ``rust`` builder supports ``--verbose`` flag (forwarded to cargo).
- The ``rust`` builder supports Clickable libraries.
- The ``rust`` builder installs the binaries into ``lib/<ARCH_TRIPLET>/bin`` (does not apply to libraries).
- Project configuration now uses yaml format and project config is called ``clickable.yaml`` (``clickale.json`` is used as fallback and json format can still be used as it is a subset of yaml)
- Build commands can be either specified as a string or a list of strings (``prebuild``, ``build``, ``postmake``, ``postbuild``).
- Added ``install_root_data`` config field to list files for installation into the click package root directory.
- Improved ignored files field to match with wildcard characters.
- Added sanity checks for paths in the config.
- Added Desktop Mode env var to allow apps detecting Clickable Desktop Mode
- Library placeholders are available to successive libraries in the sequence (useful for linking libraries against other libraries).
- Library install directories are added to ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` for successive libraries in the sequence (to enable the usage of ``find_package()``).
- Set ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` in Qt Creator run configurations.
- ``dependencies_host``, ``dependencies_target`` and ``dependencies_ppa`` now support placeholders
- Added Godot template
- Support for running Clickable on arm64 MacOS devices (except for desktop mode)

Breaking Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Overhauled command line interface with proper sub-commands, each providing specific options. See ``clickable --help`` and ``clickable <sub-command> --help``.
- The default architecture changed from ``armhf`` to the host architecture. If you want the architecture of your test device as default, it can be configured in the :ref:`Clickable config <config.yaml>`.
- The default now is to do dirty builds, if you want to do a clean build use ``clickable build --clean`` or set ``always_clean`` config field or ``CLICKABLE_ALWAYS_CLEAN=ON`` env var.
- Merged the ``build-libs`` command into ``build``.
- Merged the ``clean-libs`` command into ``clean``.
- Merged the ``test-libs`` command into ``test``.
- Scripts can only be executed through the ``script`` command.
- The ``rust`` builder has been aligned to the other builders and does not try to install manifest and desktop file automatically anymore.
- The ``rust`` builder runs ``cargo install`` instead of ``cargo build``
- The ``go`` builder has been aligned to the other builders and does not try to install all files in the project dir automatically anymore.
- The ``go`` builder does not rename the produced binary anymore.
- The ``pure`` and ``cordova`` builders no longer override manifest ``architecture`` and ``framework`` fields, unless they are set to ``@CLICK_ARCH@`` and ``@CLICK_FRAMEWORK@``.
- ``prebuild`` and ``postbuild`` are executed within the build container.
- The image setup (``image_setup``, ``dependencies_*``, ``rust_channel``) is executed for custom docker images, too.
- The image setup can be skipped with the cli flag ``--skip-image-setup``.
- Removed deprecated configuration fields.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- The ``rust`` builder does not fail any more if the source dir (containing the Cargo.toml) is a sub-directory of the project dir.
- The ``rust`` builder does not try to update the tool chain on building any more (which would fail)
- The ``rust`` builder configures the cargo target directory to match the build dir, fixing cleaning via the ``clean`` command.
- The rustup cache is made writable in the container to fix permission issues on accessing it.
- The ``go`` builder configures the package dir to match the build dir, fixing cleaning via the ``clean`` command.
- Fixed app icons not displaying in Qt Creator.
- Fixed run configuration name in Qt Creator.
- Fixed crash for QtCreator when no exec args have been found
- Fixed ``shell`` command if public SSH key is ``id_ed25519.pub``.
