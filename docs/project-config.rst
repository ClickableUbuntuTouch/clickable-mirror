.. _project-config-placeholders:

Placeholders & Environment Variables
------------------------------------

Placeholders are values provided by Clickable that can be used in some
configuration fields as ``${PLACEHOLDER}``.
All placeholders are provided as environment variables during build, additionally.
For custom environment variables see :ref:`env_vars <project-config-env_vars>`.

The following table lists all available placeholders.

======================= ======

This is an ordered list. Parameters that are used as placeholders themselves accept only predecessors.
Ex: ``${ROOT}`` can be used in ``src_dir``, but not vice-versa.

Library placeholders can be used by subsequent libraries, but not predecessors.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    build_dir: ${ROOT}/build/${ARCH_TRIPLET}/myApp

clickable_minimum_required
--------------------------

Optional, a minimum Clickable version number required to build the project.
Ex: ``"6"`` or ``"5.4.0"``

determine the framework automatically. Defaults to ``5.12``.
Ex: ``5.9``

.. _project-config-framework:

framework
---------

The SDK framework which the app should be built for. This allows Clickable to
choose the correct docker image and set the ``framework`` field in the manifest
accordingly, if desired.
Ex: ``ubuntu-sdk-16.04.4``

.. _project-config-restrict_arch:

restrict_arch
-------------

Optional, specifies an exclusive architecture that this configuration is compatible with.
This prevents the app from being build for other architectures and may also prevent the desktop mode.

To specify the architecture for building use the cli argument instead (ex: ``--arch arm64``).

.. _project-config-builder:

builder
-------

Optional, see :ref:`builders <builders>` for the full list of options.

prebuild
--------

Optional, a custom command to run from the root dir, before a build.

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings.

build
-----

A custom command to run from the build dir. Required if using the ``custom``
builder, ignored otherwise.

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings.

postmake
---------

Optional, a custom command to execute from the build directory, after make (during build). Only
used for Make-based builders.

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings.

postbuild
---------

Optional, a custom command to execute from the root dir, after build, but before click packaging.

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings.

.. _project-config-env_vars:

env_vars
--------

Optional, environment variables to be set in the build container. Ex:

.. code-block:: yaml

      TARGET_SYSTEM: UbuntuTouch

When passing ``--debug`` to Clickable, ``DEBUG_BUILD=1`` is set as an environment variable, additionally.

build_args
----------

Optional, arguments to pass to qmake, cargo or cmake.

When using ``--debug``, ``CONFIG+=debug`` is additionally appended for qmake and
``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`` for cmake and cordova builds. For cargo calls
``--release`` is added if not running Clickable with ``--debug``.

Ex: ``CONFIG+=ubuntu``

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings.

.. _project-config-make-args:

make_args
---------

Optional, arguments to pass to make, e.g. a target name. To avoid configuration
conflicts, the number of make jobs should not be specified here, but using
``make_jobs`` instead, so it can be overriden by the according environment variable.

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings.

.. _project-config-make-jobs:

make_jobs
---------

Optional, the number of jobs to use when running make, equivalent to make's ``-j``
option. If left blank this defaults to the number of CPU cores.

launch
------

Optional, a custom command to launch the app, used by ``clickable launch``.

.. _project-config-build_dir:

build_dir
---------

Optional, a custom build directory. Defaults to ``${ROOT}/build/${ARCH_TRIPLET}/app``.
Thanks to the architecture triplet, builds for different architectures can
exist in parallel.

src_dir
-------

Optional, a custom source directory. Defaults to ``${ROOT}``

Defaults to ``${BUILD_DIR}/install``

.. _project-config-install_lib:

install_lib
-----------

Optional, additional libraries that should be installed with the app and be in ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``
at runtime.
If an entry is just a file name, then Clickable looks for it in common library locations
(as listed in ``/etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf``) as well as the install dirs of libraries defined in the
libraries section.
The destination directory is ``${CLICK_LD_LIBRARY_PATH}``. Ex:

.. code-block:: yaml

    install_lib:
    - libasound.so*
    - /usr/lib/${ARCH_TRIPLET}/libasound.so*

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings.
Supports wildcards.

install_qml
-----------

Optional, additional QML files or directories that should be installed with the app and be in
``QML2_IMPORT_PATH`` at runtime. The destination directory is ``${CLICK_QML2_IMPORT_PATH}``. Ex:

.. code-block:: yaml

    install_qml:
    - /usr/lib/${ARCH_TRIPLET}/qt5/qml/Qt/labs/calendar


Relative paths are prepended with the project root dir.

QML modules will be installed to the correct directory based on the name of the module.
In the above example it will be installed to ``lib/${ARCH_TRIPLET}/Qt/labs/calendar``
because the module specified in the qmldir file is ``Qt.labs.calendar``.
Can be specified as a string or a list of strings. Supports wildcards.

install_bin
-----------

Optional, additional executables that should be installed with the app and be in ``PATH`` at runtime.
If an entry is just a file name, then Clickable looks for it in ``PATH`` as well as the install
dirs of libraries defined in the libraries section.
The destination directory is ``${CLICK_PATH}``. Ex:

.. code-block:: yaml

    install_bin:
    - htop
    - /usr/bin/htop

Relative paths are prepended with the project root dir.

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings. Supports wildcards.

install_root_data
-----------------

Optional, additional files or directories that should be installed with the app and be in the app
root dir. Ex:

.. code-block:: yaml

    install_root_data:
    - packaging/manifest.json
    - packaging/myapp.desktop

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings. Supports wildcards.

install_data
------------

Optional, additional files or directories that should be installed with the app.
Needs to be specified as a dictionary with absolute source paths as keys and destinations as value. Ex:

.. code-block:: yaml

    install_data:

Relative source paths are prepended with the project root dir and destination paths with
the install dir.

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings. Supports wildcards.
``${INSTALL_DIR}`` is added as prefix if path is not relative to the install dir.

kill
----

Optional, a custom process name to kill (used by ``clickable launch`` to kill the app before
relaunching it). If left blank the process name will be assumed.

scripts
-------

Optional, an object detailing custom commands to run. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    scripts:
      fetch: git submodule update --init
      echo-target: echo ${ARCH_TRIPLET}

That enables the use of ``clickable script fetch`` and ``clickable script echo-target``.

.. _project-config-default:

default
-------

Optional, sub-commands to run when with the ``chain`` command when no
sub-commands are specified. Defaults to ``build install launch``.
The ``--clean`` cli argument prepends ``clean`` to that list.

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings.

.. _project-config-always-clean:

always_clean
------------

Optional, whether or not to always clean app build directory before building,
disabling the build cache. Affects the ``chain``, ``build`` and ``desktop`` command.

Optional, whether or not to let the build command fail if there are review errors.
The default is ``false``.

ignore_review_warnings
----------------------

Optional, whether or not to let the build command fail if there are review warnings.
The default is ``false``.

skip_review
-----------

Optional, whether or not to skip review on click builds at all. Usually
``ignore_review_warnings`` or ``ignore_review_errors`` should be preferred.
The default is ``false``.

.. _project-config-dependencies_host:

dependencies_host
-----------------

Optional, a list of dependencies that will be installed in the build container.

Add tools here that are part of your build tool chain.

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings.

.. _project-config-dependencies_target:

dependencies_target
-------------------

Optional, a list of dependencies that will be installed in the build container.
These will be assumed to be ``dependency:arch`` (where ``arch`` is the target
architecture), unless an architecture specifier
is already appended.

Add dependencies here that your app depends on.

Can be specified as a string or a list of strings.

.. _project-config-dependencies-ppa:

dependencies_ppa
----------------

Optional, a list of PPAs, that will be enabled in the build container. Ex:

the corresponding Dockerfile).

These commands also run in container mode (CI).

env
^^^
Optional, a dictionary of env vars to add during image setup (each added as
`ENV <key>="<val>"` to the corresponding Dockerfile).

These are ignored in container mode (use
:ref:`env_vars <project-config-env_vars>` instead).

docker_image
------------

Optional, the name of a docker image to use. When building a custom docker image
it's recommended to use one of the Clickable images as a base. You can find them
on `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/u/clickable>`__.

============= ======

A single library can be build by specifying its name as
``clickable build --libs lib1 --arch arm64`` to build the library with name
``lib1`` for the architecture ``arm64``.
``clickable clean --libs lib1 --arch arm64`` cleans the libraries build dir.
``clickable test --libs lib1`` tests the library.
