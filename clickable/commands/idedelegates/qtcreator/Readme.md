QtProject.tar.xz is just a backup of settings files generated by qtcreator the first time qtcreator is launched, with a little tweak:
    As qtcreator generates a default kit with a random id by default (in QtProject/qtcreator/profiles.xml ), the aim is to overwrite it manually with a more fiendly name ( here clickable-kit) 
    so that we can bind kit with build/run configurations in projects .shared file
